---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo, open `RecipeShare.sln`, and build/run from Visual Studio.

Ensure SQL Server Express is available and the connection string is correct inside `appsettings.json`.

---

## 🧹 Database Schema & SQL Setup

The full database schema is included as a SQL script for convenience.
This can be found in the Root of the project:

```
/RecipeShare.sql
```

To create the database manually:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (or your preferred tool).
2. Create a new database (e.g., `RecipeShareDb`).
3. Run the contents of `RecipeShare.sql` against the new database.
4. Ensure the connection string in `appsettings.Development.json` (or your environment) points to the correct DB.

> **Note:**
> The script includes all tables, constraints, indexes, and cascade delete logic required for the app to function.


---

## 🧵 Test Execution Notes

To ensure integration tests pass, the database **must be seeded** before running tests.

### ✅ Seed Before Running Tests

Before executing:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Make sure you:

1. Launch the app at least once and click the **"Seed Demo Data"** button on the homepage
   **OR**
2. Manually trigger the seeding endpoint (if exposed)
3. Ensure the `DemoUser` and required lookup data exist in the database

Tests rely on:

* `DemoUser` being present
* Recipe creation logic having a valid `UserId` to assign
* Tag and image-related joins being prepped

> ⚠️ Tests will **fail or behave unexpectedly** if the seeded data is missing.

---

## 📦 Database Seeding

To seed the database with a demo user and sample recipes, click the **"Seed Demo Data"** button on the homepage after launching the app.

<details>
<summary>🔐 Demo Login Credentials (Seeded)</summary>

* **Username:** `DemoUser`
* **Password:** `Password123!`

> This account is seeded automatically and assigned the `User` role.
> Perfect for testing recipe features and profile display.

</details>

---

## 🧶 SCSS Compilation

Custom styles for the **VoidGlass Theme** are authored in SCSS and compiled to CSS for browser use.

### To edit styles:

Modify any SCSS files under:

```
RecipeShare.Web/wwwroot/voidglass/
```

### To regenerate the CSS:

You’ll need [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install). Install it via:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

Then run this from the project root:

```bash
sass wwwroot/voidglass/voidglass.scss wwwroot/css/voidglass.css --no-source-map --style=compressed
```

> ⚠️ This step is only needed if you change SCSS styles. It's not required to build or run the app.

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

The **RecipeShare API** is containerized using Docker for demonstration purposes.

### 🛠️ Build & Run:

```bash
docker build -t recipeshare-api -f ./RecipeShare.API/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 5000:80 recipeshare-api
```

Once running, access the Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

### 📌 Notes:

* The container exposes the API on internal port **80**, mapped to **localhost:5000**.
* Only the **API project** is containerized.
* The **Blazor Server frontend** runs outside Docker to avoid complications with:

  * Local database access (`host.docker.internal` issues, `sa` config, trust certs, etc.)
  * NuGet fallback path bugs inside SDK containers.
* For a smoother experience, run the API using **Visual Studio** or `dotnet run` during development.

---

## 🔍 Swagger in Production

For ease of testing and demonstration, **Swagger UI is enabled in both Development and Production**.

This is handled in `Program.cs` as follows:

```csharp
// For realworld scenarios, uncomment the below
// if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) { app.MapOpenApi(); }

// Comment this out for realworld
app.MapOpenApi();
```

In real-world deployments, Swagger should be disabled or protected in production.

---

## 🛋️ Runtime Notes

* Static image uploads are served via `/uploads` mapped in `Program.cs`:

  ```csharp
  app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions
  {
      FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(
          Path.Combine(env.WebRootPath, "uploads")),
      RequestPath = "/uploads"
  });
  ```
* Images are uploaded to:
  `/wwwroot/uploads/RecipeImages/{recipeId}/[CoverImage|Additional]/`
* New recipes use a temporary staging folder:
  `/wwwroot/uploads/TempRecipeImages/{guid}/...`, which is finalized post-creation.

---

> Tip: Use the new `.vg-panel` class to wrap entire form/card sections with VoidGlass style.
